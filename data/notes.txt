Meeting notes – Internal Review

We need to verify whether the following reference IDs still match existing entries 
in our internal system: 101, 202 and 404.

ID 404 is likely outdated but should still be checked.

Action items:
- Cross-check all references with database records.
- Prepare a summary for management.
